1. This will take ~afternoons day of work. 
About 2-3 hours to write code, and then a couple more for debugging. 5?

2a. Ethical issues would be to increasing safety vs inceasing efficiency.
2b. Ethical issues expand to make sure we send tickets to the correct people.

2e. According to by program, 46 is the correct speed. 
2f.  minimum mixed variance was 13.352049
2g. It would pick the first one, it does not happen
2h. Done

3a. mode: 7,8,16
	median: 12,
	average: 15.775
3b. mode: 7,8
	meadian: 12
	average: 15.7682
3c. best Threshold is 12, minimum mixed variance is 1.6835406
after removing one of the 16s the variance is 1.7524986

4a. estimated time 9-11 hours
4b. 5/10 (I'ma use 10 so its easier to divide) =2 
4c.  Well there's this interesting read http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/26.html
 Generally for me it's a mix of underestimating the time 
 need to plan and write the code in the first place, which stems from
 downplaying the problem at hand.
